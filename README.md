# Riemann-s_Sum
Program for Riemann's Sum project
Install Python: If you don't already have Python installed on your computer, you can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the instructions to install the appropriate version of Python for your operating system.

Install NumPy: NumPy is a popular numerical computing library for Python. You can install NumPy using the pip package manager, which comes with Python. Open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command: pip install numpy
This will download and install NumPy on your computer.

Test your installation: Download the zip file containing the program. After open the terminal and head to the zip file directory by inputing in the terminal: cd downloads/Riemann-s_Sum-main
Then run the program by typing the following command in the terminal: python riemann_sum.py
This should run the program and output the values of the area, length, and volume for the curve y = x^2 over the range [0, 1].
You can open the program and play around with the values

That's it! If you followed these steps, you should now have everything you need to run the Python program that uses the Riemann sum to calculate the area, length, and volume of a given curve.
