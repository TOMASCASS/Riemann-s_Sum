# Riemann-s_Sum
Program for Riemann's Sum project
Install Python: If you don't already have Python installed on your computer, you can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the instructions to install the appropriate version of Python for your operating system.

Install NumPy: NumPy is a popular numerical computing library for Python. You can install NumPy using the pip package manager, which comes with Python. Open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command: pip install numpy
This will download and install NumPy on your computer.

Test your installation: Download the Python code I provided, and save it as a file with a .py extension (e.g. riemann_sum.py). Then run the program by typing the following command in the terminal: python riemann_sum.py
This should run the program and output the values of the area, length, and volume for the curve y = x^2 over the range [0, 1].

That's it! If you followed these steps, you should now have everything you need to run the Python program that uses the Riemann sum to calculate the area, length, and volume of a given curve.
